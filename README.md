#### Project Configuration Fields

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `name` | Project identifier | Yes |
| `directory` | Deployment directory | Yes |
| `secret_token` | GitHub webhook secret | Yes |
| `target_branch` | Branch to trigger deployment | Yes |
| `commands` | List of commands to execute | Yes |
| `notifications` | Notification endpoints | No |

## GitHub Webhook Setup

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to Webhooks > Add webhook
3. Configure the webhook:
   - Payload URL: `http://your-server:port/webhook/your-project-name`
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Secret: Same as `secret_token` in your project config
   - Events: Select 'Push' or customize based on your needs

## Running the Service

### Development
```bash
python server.py
```

### Production
It's recommended to run the service using a process manager like systemd or supervisor.

Example systemd service file (`/etc/systemd/system/github-webhook.service`):
```ini
[Unit]
Description=GitHub Webhook Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=webhook
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/github-webhook
Environment=WEBHOOK_CONFIG=/path/to/projects.json
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 server.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable github-webhook
sudo systemctl start github-webhook
```

## Monitoring

### Health Check

Monitor the service health using the `/health` endpoint:
```bash
curl http://your-server:port/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-13T10:00:00.000Z",
    "config_file": "projects.json"
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Keep webhook secrets secure
3. Use environment variables for sensitive data
4. Regularly update dependencies
5. Limit command execution permissions
6. Use specific branches for deployments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook Not Triggering**
   - Check if the webhook URL is accessible
   - Verify the secret token matches
   - Check GitHub webhook delivery logs

2. **Command Execution Fails**
   - Verify directory permissions
   - Check if required tools are installed
   - Review the service logs

3. **Notifications Not Working**
   - Verify SMTP/Slack/Mattermost credentials
   - Check network connectivity
   - Review notification service logs

### Logs

Check the service logs:
```bash
# If running with systemd
sudo journalctl -u github-webhook -f

# Direct output
python server.py > webhook.log 2>&1
```
